# azure-cosmos-distributed-bulk-sample
## Distributed bulk sample in Azure Cosmos DB
### Summary
This sample shows how a workload can ingest a large amount of data - billions of documents into Cosmos DB. The sample allows distributing the ingestion of a set of files containing the input (this sample uses text files where each line contains the json with the document's payload). To allow making the ingestion restartable and tracking of the status of the ingestion pipeline a metadata container in Cosmos DB is used. Each ingestion job will track status for each input file - and each file is split into a number of smaller batches. The ingestion will then process batch by batch and update the status. If the application stops and needs to be restarted the smallest amount of work that would need to be repeated is a batch.
The input files are expected to be stored in an Azure Storage container.

### Configuration
The sample uses various configuration options to determine authentication, which Storage account to expect the input files in and which Cosmos DB resource to use for data ingestion etc. These configuration options need to be set via Java system properties environment variables - if both are specified the system property will be used. The ´Importance´ column expresses how important it is to set the configuration for this setting correctly - ´LOW´means the setting is optional, and it is not expected that the default needs to be changed often. `HIGH` means this setting needs to be carefully evaluated depending on the workload - `REQUIRED` means the setting has to be specified.

### Very high level design description
For each batch (chunk of an input file) some context is captured and will be passed through the lifecycle of the ingestion. The chunk of documents to be processed is stored in a `Batch`. Processing the batch is done by invoking the correct operation in `DocumentBulkExecutor` to upsert/insert/delete etc. For each method invocation - tracking the ingestion of all documents of this batch an is captured in `DocumentBulkExecutorOperationStatus`. Here status like the number of successfully ingested documents, the number of outstanding operations, any failures (exceeding the defined retry count) etc. is captured.
Each worker will process a configurable (see `COSMOS.MAX_CONCURRENT_BATCHES_PER_MACHINE`) number of batches - the higher, the more documents can be processed per machine - as long as the machine is not overloaded (monitor CPU/memory).
